    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>This video showcases our VR model of the CANDU Calandria.The VR environment is comprised of a full-scale model of a CANDU
            reactor and a variety of simulations to demonstrate its functionality. This project incorporates innovative virtual reality technologies to the nuclear field to
            modernize the education and training process regarding CANDU reactors. A remotely accessible VR
            model and simulations of the CANDU nuclear reactor for online teaching and training provides an
            interactive, and immersive full-scale 3D model of a CANDU reactor. The VR environment of the 3D
            CANDU reactor allows users to walk-through and explore its mechanisms and functions.</p>

                <h3>CANDU Reactors</h3>
                <p>The VR environment of the 3D CANDU reactor allows users to walk-
                    through and explore its mechanisms and functionalities. The VR model is unique to the nuclear research
                    community since it utilizes a 3D full-scale model of a CANDU reactor and is capable of simulating
                    processes such as nuclear fission.</p>
